Population growth and rising living standards in Colombia and around the world have led to an increased demand for food, driving agricultural production into the last remaining natural lands. In Colombia, the Orinoquia region represents the second-largest savanna system in South America and is considered the country’s final agricultural frontier. Currently, the Colombian Orinoquia is experiencing rapid expansion of large-scale agricultural development, including oil palm, rubber, and eucalyptus plantations, as well as annual crops such as rice, corn, and soybeans—primarily to meet growing domestic demand.

Other regions in Colombia have undergone similar agricultural booms, often with little or no planning regarding land-use changes and the associated infrastructure for energy and communications, leading to significant losses in biodiversity and ecosystem services. Thus, MoHiTo (Hydrological Modeling Tool for Decision-Making) emerges as a tool born out of the need to understand how water resources in the Colombian Orinoquia could be impacted by future pressures from various water-dependent sectors.

Under this premise, the project “Landscape planning for agro-industrial expansion in a large, well-preserved savanna: how to plan multifunctional landscapes at scale for nature and people in the Orinoquia region, Colombia” was developed through an interinstitutional and interdisciplinary framework involving SIAT, WCS, and The Nature Conservancy.
